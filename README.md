# Pokemane
Code for my video game

Pokemane is a basic Pok√©mon-style game that was designed and coded using HTML and Vanilla JavaScript.
Implemented data structures (arrays) and algorithms (loops, conditional statements) for collision detection,
boundary creation, and player movement, enhancing the app's interactivity and user experience.
I worked independently and reviewed source code to assure quality and precision of work.
